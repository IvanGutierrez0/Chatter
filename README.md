# Chatter
A home-made walkie-talkie for text and voice chatting 

## About the project
This is **chatter** a sort of walkie-talkie for primarily text communication although it is also intended for voice transmission. We will be posting updates about the project as it comes together. Our intention is to keep the price in between **25 to 35 euros** for one of the two walkies. Note that you will need at least two of them to communicate. Anyone, **independently of their skill level**, will be able to build this project as there will be extensive documentation on the building process although more experienced tinkers might be able to make better and cleaner project with custom PCBs or better 3D-printed cases.

## We will give you:
• The parts list and where to buy them\n
• The schematics and photos of the device
• The 3D model of the case
• The code and a guide to understand it
• A full guide to build the chatter
